 ## Description
For week 13 our student challenge was to build a backend for an e-commerce site using MySQL2 and sequalize packages. Already given some starter code, our goal was to set up the api routes for us to call later and filling in the databases in each models file. We were also needed to create associations to establish relationships between different models.

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself.

 ## Usage
The main usage of this challenge was to demonstrate my ability to utilize all my resources and knowledge to take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I used the student mini project for week 13 to help give me a sense of direction on where to start. I also used some of the functions provided by it as well.<br />
 I would also like to credit the module itself as it helped me set up the models and giving me hints in order to setup the relationships between them.

 ## Testing
To test my application, you must first download my code from my github, and launch it using your preffered coding application. You would then need to create a .env file and set it up using the .env.EXAMPLE as a template, Next you want to SOURCE the schema.sql using the mysql -u root -p in the terminal for schema.sql, next you would then run the command npm run seed to add the seed data into the schema, and finally we would simply right click server.js and click open new terminal and run the command node server. After doing all this the user should use insomnia and use the localhost line to test out the api to see if you can GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT.
